# Plugin List and info

## Plugins
###Text editing

Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air.

- [Clever F](https://github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim)

Improves the `f`/`t` commands in a very intuitive way and also frees up the `,` and `;` keys.

- [vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)

Multiple Cursors for VIM. For the occasions when VIM's `gn` motion isn't powerful enough or you need more visual feedback.

Very nice plugin! Substantially faster, less buggy, better visual feedback and a lot more features than the old Multiple Cursors plugin. Actually the first incarnation of multiple cursors in VIM that I really like.

As an alternative to multiple cursor editing you can put a mapping like `nnoremap <silent> M *``cgn` in your vimrc to quickly replace the word under the cursor by pressing `M`. This can be repeated with `.`, so one can jump to and replace the next occurrence or use `n` to skip to the next occurrence without replacing.

- [vim-easy-align](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align)
	- A simple, easy-to-use Vim alignment plugin.

### UI Enhancments
- [Traces](https://github.com/markonm/traces.vim)

Live highlight of patterns and range commands (`substitute`, `global`, â€¦). Super useful when crafting complex regex searches and/or replacements. Should be built-in functionality.
